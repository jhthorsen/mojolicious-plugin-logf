    Mojolicious::Plugin::Logf is a plugin which will log complex
    datastructures and avoid "unitialized" warnings.

SYNOPSIS
      use Mojolicious::Lite;
      plugin "Logf";

      get "/" => sub {
        my $self = shift;

        $self->logf(info => 'request: %s', $self->req->params->to_hash);
      };
